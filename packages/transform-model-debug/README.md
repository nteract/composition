# Transform Model Debug

Largely only for debugging usage during the evaluation of comm models in nteract.

Intended to be used with `@nteract/transforms`. Note that this transform is bundled
in `@nteract/transforms-full`.

## Installation

You may use whichever package manager (`npm` or `yarn`) best suits your workflow. The `nteract` team internally uses `yarn`.

```bash
npm install @nteract/transform-model-debug
# OR
yarn add @nteract/transform-model-debug
```

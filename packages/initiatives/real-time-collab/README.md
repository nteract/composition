# Roadmap for Real-time Collaboration

Research and data science teams use and share the notebook amongst
each other in order to complete their work. However, collaborating
on the same notebook at the same time is a cumbersome process. Our goal
is to simplify this process and implement real-time collaboration
backed by GitHub gists.

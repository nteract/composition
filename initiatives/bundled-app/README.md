# Roadmap for Bundled Application

A large majority of interactive notebook users use notebooks against a
traditional SciPy stack. Sometimes installing this stack can be difficult.
Although tools like `conda` make the process easier it can still be a
hassle for some users. Our bundled kernel intiative aims to make this
easier. By using the nteract application with a bundled kernel, the
barrier to entry for using the SciPy stack with an interactive notebook
is greatly reduced. Once users are comfortable with the setup, they can
chose to adopt more complex stacks with their interactive notebooks.

With a bundled kernel, users can download a version of the nteract application
with a bundled conda environment for their system architecture. This reduces
the hassle for users that just want to get up and running with a
simple SciPy stack.

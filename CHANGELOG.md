### Component documentation

We're in the beginnings of documenting our components using [react-styleguidist](https://react-styleguidist.js.org/). You can see a sneak preview at [components.nteract.io](https://components.nteract.io).

### Gist publishing

Gist publishing is much improved! _However_, GitHub no longer allows new anonymous gists. All gists published from nteract must use authentication.

## Miscellaneous

- Improved Kernel Clean Up
- Better font sizes in drop down menu

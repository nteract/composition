## Tracking in the nteract Application

nteract currently uses Google Analytics to measure user engagement with
our application.

Why do we include tracking in our application? Tracking helps us determine
metrics about engagement and usage that allow us to create compelling statistics
for grant applications. Analytics also helps us determine where we should focus
internationalization efforts or what platforms we should focus our debugging
efforts on.

What kind of information do we collect?
- How many times was nteract used?
- How long was nteract used in each session?
- In what country was nteract used?
- What operating system was nteract used in?

We do not collect any personally identifying information.
